    <p>Bees drink water using their proboscis. The same long straw-like appendage they use to suck up nectar from flowers.</p>
    <p>Natural Water Bodies: Bees often frequent rivers, lakes, and ponds to collect water.<br>
Dew on Plants: Early in the morning, bees can be seen sipping dew directly from leaves and grass.<br>
Bird Baths: These are popular man-made sources, especially if they are shallow or have pebbles for bees to land on<br>.
Dripping Taps or Leaky Faucets: Bees use these consistent drips as a reliable water source.
Wet Soil or Mud Puddles: Bees sometimes visit these areas, especially in drier climates where water is scarce.<br>
Garden Features: Water fountains, sprinklers, drip irrigation systems, and swimming pools.<br>
Rainwater Collection Systems: Barrels or buckets that accumulate water over time.<br>
Potted Plant Saucers: Hold excess water from watering plants.<br>
But it turns out that bees can get pretty resourceful in their hunt for water.</br>

Some species of solitary bees opt to get their hydration from the tears and sweat of mammals.</p>
